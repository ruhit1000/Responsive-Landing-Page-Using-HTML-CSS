## Overview
In this challenge, I created a recipe page that displays a list of ingredients and instructions for preparing a dish. The goal was to practice HTML and CSS skills, focusing on creating a visually appealing and user-friendly layout. The page includes a header, a section for ingredients, and a section for preparation steps, all styled with modern CSS techniques.

### My Process

To start the project, I first reviewed the challenge requirements and the provided design files. I then set up my development environment by creating the necessary HTML and CSS files. 

1. **HTML Structure**: I began by structuring the HTML with semantic elements such as `<header>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`. I ensured that the content was organized logically, with a clear separation between the ingredients and preparation steps.

2. **CSS Styling**: Next, I moved on to styling the page using CSS. I used CSS custom properties for consistent theming and applied Flexbox and Grid layouts to create a responsive design. I focused on making the page visually appealing and easy to navigate.

3. **Testing and Refinement**: After the initial implementation, I tested the page across different browsers and devices to ensure compatibility and responsiveness. I made adjustments as needed to improve the user experience and fix any layout issues.

4. **Final Touches**: Finally, I added some finishing touches, such as hover effects and transitions, to enhance the interactivity of the page. I also optimized the images and code for better performance.

By following this process, I was able to create a well-structured and visually appealing recipe page that meets the challenge requirements.
